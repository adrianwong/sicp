; The formulas for `par1` and `par2` are algebraically
; identical. 

; (1/(1/R1 + 1/R2))
; = (1/(1/R1 + 1/R2)) * (R1/R1) * (R2/R2)
; = (R1 * R2)/(R1 + R2)

; However, as can be seen from the previous exercise, dividing
; an interval by itself does not equal 1, thus transforming
; one equation into another introduces errors

; Therefore, Eva Lu Ator is correct. If we avoid repeating variables
; that represent uncertain numbers, we produce tighter error bounds
