; Provide generic operations `sine`, `cosine`, `arctan`, `square`
; and `sqrt`. Implement these operations for `scheme-number`,
; `rational`, and any other numbers we wish to add to the system.
;
; Then, modify the `rectangular` and `polar` packages to make use
; of these generic operations. Also, replace the primitive arithmetic
; operations `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` in the `rectangular`, `polar`
; and `complex` packages with their generic operation equivalents
